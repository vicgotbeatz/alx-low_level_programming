C - Function pointers

TASKS

0. What's my name

Write a function that prints a name.


Prototype: void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *));


1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done

Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.


Prototype: void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int));


where size is the size of the array and action is a pointer to the function you need to use.


2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities

Write a function that searches for an integer.


Prototype: int int_index(int *array, int size, int (*cmp)(int));


where size is the number of elements in the array array


cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values


int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0


If no element matches, return -1


If size <= 0, return -1


3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at

Write a program that performs simple operations.


You are allowed to use the standard library


Usage: calc num1 operator num2


You can assume num1 and num2 are integers, so use the atoi function to convert them from the string input to int


operator is one of the following:


+: addition

-: subtraction

*: multiplication

/: division

%: modulo

The program prints the result of the operation, followed by a new line


You can assume that the result of all operations can be stored in an int


if the number of arguments is wrong, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 98


if the operator is none of the above, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 99


if the user tries to divide (/ or %) by 0, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 100


This task requires that you create four different files.


3-calc.h

This file should contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program. You can use this structure:

3-op_functions.c

This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more):


op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b);

op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b);

op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b);

op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b);

op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);

3-get_op_func.c

This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. Youâ€™re not allowed to declare any other function.


Prototype: int (*get_op_func(char *s))(int, int);

where s is the operator passed as argument to the program

This function returns a pointer to the function that corresponds to the operator given as a parameter. Example: get_op_func("+") should return a pointer to the function op_add

You are not allowed to use switch statements

You are not allowed to use for or do ... while loops

You are not allowed to use goto

You are not allowed to use else

You are not allowed to use more than one if statement in your code

You are not allowed to use more than one while loop in your code

If s does not match any of the 5 expected operators (+, -, *, /, %), return NULL

You are only allowed to declare these two variables in this function:

3-main.c

This file should contain your main function only.


You are not allowed to code any other function than main in this file

You are not allowed to directly call op_add, op_sub, op_mul, op_div or op_mod from the main function

You have to use atoi to convert arguments to int

You are not allowed to use any kind of loop -

You are allowed to use a maximum of 3 if statements

4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker

Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.


Usage: ./main number_of_bytes


Output format:


the opcodes should be printed in hexadecimal, lowercase

each opcode is two char long

listing ends with a new line

see example

You are allowed to use printf and atoi


You have to use atoi to convert the argument to an int


If the number of argument is not the correct one, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1


If the number of bytes is negative, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 2


You do not have to compile with any flags
